# Legislative Bill Analysis

Structured analysis of legislation through dual lenses: general policy intent and State of CT CISO operational impact. Produces concise, decision-ready output.

## Workflow

### 1. Source the Bill Text

Obtain the full bill text before analysis. Prefer official sources:
- CT General Assembly: `cga.ct.gov` (PDF or HTML). If SSL fails, use `curl -skL` to fetch PDFs.
- Fallbacks: LegiScan, BillTrack50, TrackBill

Never analyze from summaries alone. Third-party AI summaries miss amendments to existing statutes, which often contain the most consequential changes.

### 2. Dispatch Comparison Agent (Background)

Launch a background agent to search for comparable legislation while you analyze. Agent instructions:
- Search for bills with similar subject matter in current and prior 2 legislative sessions
- Focus on passed laws (not just introduced) in comparator jurisdictions: NY, CA, CO, IL, and EU
- Note meaningful differences in scope, enforcement, and compliance requirements
- Report in under 200 words

### 3. Analyze and Output

Keep total output under 1500 words. Brevity forces prioritization.

## Output Format

### METADATA

Table: bill number, session, LCO number, committee, sponsors, effective date, current status, page count.

### SUMMARY

Two paragraphs max. What the bill does and who it affects. Plain language -- writable into an email to a commissioner.

### STATED INTENT

5-7 bullets mapped to section numbers. What the bill openly aims to accomplish.

### STRUCTURAL EFFECTS

5-7 bullets. Second-order consequences: compliance moats, power shifts, litigation surfaces, chilling effects, procurement gates, industry consolidation.

### AFFECTED PARTIES

Table mapping each obligated party to their duties and the sections that create them.

### EXISTING LAW CHANGES

Each statute amended, what it currently says, and what the bill changes. This is where consequential provisions hide.

### CISO IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Analyze across these domains. Skip any that genuinely don't apply. 1-2 sentences per domain with section references.

| Domain | What to assess |
|--------|---------------|
| Security tooling | EDR, SIEM, SOAR, insider threat, DLP, behavioral analytics, phishing simulation |
| Procurement | Approval gates, authorization requirements, vendor contract obligations |
| Workforce/HR intersection | Where security monitoring crosses into employment decisions |
| State agency obligations | What applies to BITS specifically vs. private sector only |
| Collective bargaining | Impact on deploying tools for unionized state employees |
| Data governance | Retention, disclosure, audit trail, bias audit recordkeeping |
| Public disclosure risk | Whether compliance creates information adversaries can exploit |
| Legal exposure | Private right of action, AG enforcement, discrimination claim surface |

### TIMELINE

Table of compliance deadlines, effective dates, audit windows, notice periods.

### RECOMMENDATION

2-3 sentences. Support, oppose, or amend -- with the specific provisions that drive the recommendation. Frame from CISO operational perspective.

### ACTION ITEMS

3-5 concrete next steps for BITS if this bill is likely to pass.

### COMPARABLE LEGISLATION

Incorporate comparison agent findings. 3-5 bullets comparing to similar laws in other jurisdictions.

## After Delivery

Offer testimony support as a follow-up:

> "Would you like me to prepare testimony talking points for this bill? I can draft points for support, opposition, or amendment recommendations aligned to your CISO position."

## Analysis Guidance

- Lead with what matters to a CISO, not what matters to a legislator.
- When a provision is ambiguous about whether security tools are covered, flag it -- ambiguity IS the risk.
- Always check for the "sleeper provision": the amendment to existing law buried late in the bill that has outsized impact.
- Don't editorialize in SUMMARY. Save judgment for STRUCTURAL EFFECTS and RECOMMENDATION.
